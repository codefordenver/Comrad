## What is Comrad?

Comrad is an open-source web application for use by community radio stations that helps with crucial show scheduling and playlist entry to organize all on air and streaming processes for hosts and DJâ€™s. There is an initial version of it in use at KGNU in Boulder, CO, but the system needs several feature and usability improvements to bring it to the point where other community radio stations can adopt it.

This fellowship will allow the building of Comrad 2.0, permitting a standalone open source distribution in English and Spanish that will greatly benefit the small to mid-sized community radios as well as the hundreds of budget limited Lower Power FM radios just taking to the air in the United States.
